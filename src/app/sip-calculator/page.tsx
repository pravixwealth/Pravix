    question: "What is a SIP calculator?",
    answer:
      "A SIP calculator is a financial tool that estimates the future value of your Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) based on your monthly investment amount, expected rate of return, and investment duration. It uses the compound interest formula to project your wealth growth over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I invest in SIP per month?",
    answer:
      "The ideal SIP amount depends on your financial goals, current income, and expenses. A common guideline is to invest 20-30% of your monthly income. Pravix helps you calculate the exact SIP amount needed based on your specific goal — whether it is retirement, a child's education, or buying a home.",
  },
  {
    question: "What returns can I expect from SIP investments in India?",
    answer:
      "Historical returns for equity mutual funds in India have averaged 12-15% annually over 10+ year periods. However, returns vary based on market conditions, fund selection, and investment horizon. Debt funds typically return 6-8% annually. Pravix factors in your risk profile to provide realistic projections.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is SIP better than lump sum investing?",
    answer:
      "SIP offers rupee cost averaging, which reduces the impact of market volatility by spreading your investments over time. For most salaried individuals, SIP is more practical as it aligns with monthly income. However, lump sum can outperform SIP in steadily rising markets. Pravix analyzes both approaches for your specific situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Pravix SIP planning differ from other calculators?",
    answer:
      "Unlike basic SIP calculators, Pravix provides goal-based planning that considers your complete financial picture — income, expenses, existing savings, risk profile, and inflation. It generates a personalized allocation across equity, debt, gold, and liquid assets, with scenario analysis showing conservative, moderate, and optimistic outcomes.",

            What is a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-[#50607d]">
            A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a disciplined method of investing a fixed amount in mutual
            funds at regular intervals — typically monthly. SIP allows Indian investors to benefit from
            <strong> rupee cost averaging</strong> and the <strong>power of compounding</strong>, making it
            one of the most effective wealth-building strategies available today.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-[#50607d]">
            Whether you are saving for retirement, your child&apos;s education, or buying a home, SIP provides a
            structured path to achieve your financial goals without trying to time the market. With as little
            as ₹500 per month, anyone can start building wealth through SIP investments in India.

            How Does a SIP Calculator Work?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-[#50607d]">
            A SIP calculator uses the <strong>future value of annuity formula</strong> to project your

          </div>
          <p className="mt-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-[#50607d]">
            The formula accounts for compounding at regular intervals, showing how small monthly investments
            can grow into substantial wealth over 10, 15, or 20+ years. For example, investing ₹10,000/month
            at 12% annual returns for 20 years can grow to approximately ₹1 crore.
